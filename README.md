# Assign_DB_Design

Welcome to my Data Management Project repository! This project showcases a comprehensive approach to database design and management, featuring a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations, SQL code for database definition and manipulation, and a visual datamart diagram created with draw.io.

Objectives:

To illustrate the process of designing a relational database.
To demonstrate table creation using Data Definition Language (DDL) and data loading techniques.
To provide a clear, visual representation of the datamart structure.

Technologies Used:

1. SQL
2. Python (Jupyter Notebook)
3. draw.io for diagram creation

Here's how to navigate and use the contents of this repository:

Jupyter Notebook: Explore the .ipynb file for detailed Markdown explanations and SQL code.

Datamart Diagram: View the .png or .drawio file to see the structure of the datamart.

Repository Structure:

/notebooks: Contains the Jupyter notebook files.

/diagrams: Includes the datamart diagram in both draw.io and image formats.
