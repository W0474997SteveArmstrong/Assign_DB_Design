# Assign_DB_Design

Welcome to the repository of our Data Management Project, which showcases a comprehensive approach to designing and managing a database for a self-driving car system. This project includes a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations, SQL code for defining and manipulating the database, and a visual datamart diagram created using draw.io.

Project Overview:

The focus of this project is to develop a database that efficiently handles and analyzes data from a fleet of self-driving cars. The database structure is designed to manage and store information about the cars, their sensors, trips made, and maintenance records.

Technologies Used:

1. Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding, data analysis, and comprehensive documentation.
2. SQL: Used for database creation, data manipulation, and performing complex queries.
3. draw.io: For creating visual representations of our database schema.

Database Structure:

Our database consists of the following main tables:
1. Cars: Contains details about each car in the fleet.
2. Sensors: Records information about the sensors installed in each car. 
3. Trips: Logs data related to trips made by each car. 
4. Maintenance: Keeps track of maintenance activities for each vehicle.

Each table is designed with appropriate relationships to support complex queries and data analysis. 

Advanced Data Analysis:

This project includes advanced SQL queries to analyze the database for:

1. Most Common Maintenance Activities.
2. Analysis of Maintenance Frequency After Long Trips.
3. Car Utilization Analysis Based on Mileage.
4. Correlation Between Car Age and Maintenance Needs.

Visual Data Representation:

A datamart diagram is provided to visualize the database structure, illustrating the relationships between different tables and entities in our database. This diagram is an essential tool for understanding the overall design and flow of data.
